Life was created by the combination of light, earth, and water. 
Gaia is life and yearns for unity.
Its followers, Gaians, interpret this in many ways.
As always unity brings division.

Most followers cherish life. They farm, heal others, protect the environment, etc. Some think death is the great unifier and praise the degraders and carrion feeders. An even smaller subset hold hard to the wheel of life.
