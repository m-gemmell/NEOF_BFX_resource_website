Ablation occurs to meteoroids as they enter the earth's atmosphere.
This is due to the erosive impacts of atmospheric particles.

Sol was a Brazilian astronaut, carrying out research upon the high orbit USA space station "Laser-US".
This space station was developed as a means to deflect asteroids via laser ablation.
This was part of a worldwide effort with the "Las-ERA", "Laser-CAC", "La-SAE", and "Laser-Oceania" all in development.

During their time on the Laser-US a laser experiment they were carrying out went wrong.
This led to the station exploding, with everyone but Sol dying on it.
Sol was able to exit the station on an escape pod.

This too went disastrously wrong as the pod burnt up.
Sol survived but came out ablated, a smooth human with no hair or recognisable features.
The US government blamed Sol for the accident, firing them, and discrediting their work.
Now Sol only wants to make them regret that.

Since their ablation, Sol has taken an interest in mind control.
[Dr. Petra Pufferfish](/Gaia/Dr_Petra_Pufferfish), subsequently recruited Sol as one of her chief lieutenants for their expertise in Lasers and mind control.

Sol's plan to help with world domination involves holding the USA to ransom.
This will involve using [asteroid laser ablation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_laser_ablation) to have meteorites strike certain cities.
