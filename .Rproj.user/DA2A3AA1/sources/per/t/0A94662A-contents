## Mission

[DOT raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_Raiders.qmd) charge the team with infiltrating The Big Hole dump yard in Kimberley, South Africa.
Dump yards are where trash, chemicals, and nuclear waste are disposed of by tipping it into the [DOT](/tartarus/qmd#the-dot).
These sites are heavily guarded due to the contents but also to stop DOT raiders and creatures from reaching the surface via the mouth into and out of the DOT.

This site was originally the [Big Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hole) open pit quarry.
However, once they found the mouth into the DOT the developed into a dump yard.
They made the hole wider and now it removes the vast majority of hazardous trash for the [CAC](/History/CAC.qmd) and some neighbouring countries.
It is run by __Carafe__, a subsidiary company of [Kraken](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd).

FIST are provided with a floppy disk by the DOT raiders to disable the security systems including automated turrets. However, it will also disable the Kaiju Sonic Disruption System (KSDS).
When/if this occurs small kaiju to rush into the dumping site only to be followed by a massive kaiju. 
This kaiju consists three gigantic snakes connected by a giant obsidian orb.

Double twist, this was a plan by [The Mooners](/History/The_moon.html) to test out one of their mecha against a real kaiju. 
Once the snake Kaiju emerges the KSDS will reactivate, stopping further Kaiju from coming in.
The team will be able to pilot a mecha hidden in a skyscraper sized crate to stop the Kaiju.
There will also be back-up rods from god on hand if the mecha fails.



## The Big Hole dump yard

The dump yard is a large circular hole with sheer vertical walls.
Dark, noisy, deep, and hot it is easy to forget you can look up at the sky.
There are only two ways in and out.

### Elevator

At the north of the hole is a large open elevator going from the surface to the bottom of the pit.
It is primarily used to move loaded cargo crates down, fill of trash, and empty crates back up.
So utilitarian is the large elevator that passengers are transported up and down in a designated cargo crate.

At the surface near the elevator lie many train tracks and container cranes train station.
It runs 24/7 with many trains coming and going.

The elevator is slow and takes a long time to go up or down.
It makes up for this by being able to transport 20,000 cargo crates at a time.

### The Node {#security}

The node is a large 5 story cylindrical building in the very centre of the Big Hole.
Blacked out Windows line the entire circumference, with the bright white concrete it gives off the appearance of a striped vase.
Another post-modern brutalist building, walls within the building either curve parallel to the circumference or run radially.

The Node acts as the main building for staff with security increasing as you go up the floors.
There are no stairs instead a single pill shaped elevator in the centre of the building provides access to the floors.
However, this elevator requires a pair of security cards, therefore requiring 2 passenger at a time.

#### Ground floor

__Reception, museum, and canteen (Level 1 security)__

The entrance of the building contains a reception and a small museum about The Big Hole and the Carafe company at the front. It is all boring, sterile corporate propaganda.

A large room at the back contains a canteen for the staff.

#### 1st floor

__Living quarters and recreation rooms (Level 1 security)__

There are various recreation rooms with tvs, tables for games, and libraries. It is a surprisingly still place, employees taking a reprieve from the exhausting labour. They live in these quarters for 14 days whilst working, then go to their home until they want/need to work another shift. 

A separate section for security guards requires a pair of Level 3 security passes to access.

#### 2nd floor

__Operations and engineering (Level 2 security)__

Where the real work in the building is done. Teams leads of workers congregate to meet and coordinate the day to day running. This includes the crane workers. 

There are also workrooms for engineers to fix smaller issues and help other engineers via radio. The rooms contain many tools and manuals.

#### 3rd floor

__Management (Level 3 security)__

Offices for any important members of staff. Contains a few penthouses for visiting VIPs. Furnished with expensive paintings specifically designed to fit along the curved walls.

#### 4th floor

__Security (Level 3 security)__
