## Mission

The team are hired by [Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd) to investigate the deadly infestation of bipedal Horseshoe crabs ([HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd)) on [Lantau Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantau_Island) and [Chek Lap Kok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chek_Lap_Kok).
[Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd) had started building the Hong Kong International airport on [Chek Lap Kok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chek_Lap_Kok), this has been stopped due to the infestation.

The islands are being quarantined from the rest of Hong Kong with martial law in place.
All citizens have been rounded up to [Tung Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung), a fishing village turned town due to the new labour force for airport construction.

The team has special dispensation to take care of the menace but the military and others will not look kindly if they are caught snooping in the affairs of government of other companies.
[Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd) will provide them with a translator who knows the main language of the team and Cantonese (the main language of Hong Kong), the translator will only stay in the military guarded safe zone .

## What is going on?

__Rangi Doshi__ ([CGC SCIENTIST](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist)) and his team of [CGC SCIENTISTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist) have created the [HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd), see why [below](#ranga_n_cgc).
One of the breeding [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) was blessed by all four of the Primeval deities, it then escaped the facility via the sewers.
It became a BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT, producing many HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS.

It has become intelligent and formed a hive mind with its children, aiming to find and rescue its brethren from the CGC.
It is staying within the Mangrove west of [Tung Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung) ([Hong Kong Wetland Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Wetland_Park) as of 2006).
It does not remember where it escaped from only that it smelt of human blood, the sick, and the dead.
It sends out most of its daughters ([FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant)) to search.
It produces an abundance of offspring with 4 [MALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) that were on the its back when it escaped the lab.

## Clues

### Sightings

The [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant)

### Food poisoning

A local restaurant, famous for only serving crustaceans and no fish, is being closed down by the police as patrons have died of food poisoning. 
Some victims who were admitted to Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research) are being successfully treated.
Those who went to North Lantau Hospital or Tung Chung Health Centre did not survive.

If they confront the owner or get information from the police they will find out the owner has been serving the [HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#horseshoe_crab_mutant).
This is because their usual supply of canned horseshoe meat has a shortage.
Unknown to them their supply was from CGC who's prized spawner escaped.

If the team successfully investigate at Yan Oi Tong they will find out the patients were treated for pufferfish poisoning (tetrodotoxin).
One of the CGC scientists gave this advice to one of the doctors.

### Medical conference

Unfortunately a medical conference was in force at one of [Tung Chung's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung) hotels.
This means many medical researchers and doctors are stuck during the quarantine.
This keeps the nicest hotel out of the hands on evacuees and the military which they are more than happy to grumble about.

The large conference room has been changed into a disaster relief zone with many makeshift beds.
The occupants are using the leftover posters as extra blankets.
One poster is about Horseshoe crabs and how their blood is harvested to create compounds to help test vaccines.

### Clogged sewers





## Ranga and the CGC {#ranga_n_cgc}

__Ranga Doshi__ and his team works for the [CGC](/Gaia/CGC.qmd).
They carry out research in a hidden and secure floor below the basement of the Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research). Although they can speak cantonese, yhey are so secretive they communicate and write in Hindi for the job.
CGC specifically sent a hindi team to Hong Kong for this reason.

The team carries out research and experiments on [Mangrove horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_horseshoe_crab) and [Atlantic horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_horseshoe_crab).

[Atlantic horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_horseshoe_crab) are collected to harvest their blood.
The blood contains amebocytes which are used to create LALs, used to test vaccines.

[Mangrove horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_horseshoe_crab) contain [tetrodotoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin).
This is a lethal neurotoxin, the same that makes pufferfish, blue-ringed octopuses and other animals so deadly.
Although deadly, if used correctly it can also be used as a treatment of cancer-associated pain.
Additionally, it may also be able to be used as a recreational drug, as seen by dolphins who get high on it via pufferfish.

The team genetically engineered the Horseshoe crab mutants.
The blood of the [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) is harvested for LALs.
Additionally, their roe is sold as food.
A few [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) are used to spawn more Horseshoe crab mutants.
Once their blood production or spawn rate reduces below a threshold they are killed and their tetrodotoxin is harvested.
The [MALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Proteus/CGC.qmd#male_horseshoe_crab_mutant) are either used to fertilise eggs or sell as meat since they do not contain tetrodotoxin.

The CGC research floor contains research rooms, dissection rooms, harvesting pens, spawning pens, and preparation rooms.
All rooms have large windows that allow a generous view into and from the hallways.
The [CGC SCIENTISTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist) are working within the research rooms and dissection rooms.
[CGC SECURITY](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#security) patrol the halls and attend the Horseshoe crab mutants in the harvesting pens.

[CGC SCIENTISTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist) and [CGC SECURITY](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#security) who are unlucky or have annoyed __Ranga__ are stuck in the preparation rooms.
There are four different preparation rooms:

- __Roe prep:__ Roe are passed through a fine-mesh screen, salted and packed into metal tins, ready for sale.
- __Meat prep:__ Males are cleaned and cut. The meat is then shredded and refrigerated. It is then sent to a canning company.


Their are no recreational rooms, staff having to use other floors for this.
Their are 2 toilets but one is out of service as it was ripped off the floor when the BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT escaped.
The exposed pipe has been blocked.
