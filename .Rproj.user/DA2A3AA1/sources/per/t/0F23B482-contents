__UNDER CONSTRUCTION__

Dr. Petra Pufferfish is the Primeval Polytheist and a super villain.
She is the only living being favoured by all the Primeval Deities.
She is especially liked by Gaia, the deity of life and unity.
Her plans involve the subjugation of the world so it may finally be united under her rule.
Many follow her cause.
They perceive her connection to all the deities as a sign of righteousness.
Her chief lieutenants are Blanchard, Kohitar, and Sol.

As well as being a super villain, Petra is also a super scientist.
She is pedantic and hates acronyms, she won't pronounce them correctly out of disrespect.
She loves long and descriptive names for her machines and harshly criticises her lieutenants when they try to use acronyms.
Curiously she dislikes the arbitrary nature of people's names and will frequently use only the first syllable when referring to people.
Of course she demands all her minions to use her full name, Dr. Petra Pufferfish.

Dr. Petra Pufferfish is an expert on genetics and cloning.
As with many egomaniacs she wants to live for ever and she has figured out how.
With Blanchard's technology she has frozen her body in such a way that allows her brain to function normally.
Whilst frozen like this she makes clones of her self.
Due to her genius these clones mature in weeks and have a copy of her mind.
Additionally, they have an enhanced physique and powers.
This cloning and gene editing requires a lot of energy which is made by Kohitar's battery technology. 

The clones only live for a year but she has made this a benefit.
With Sol's technology she is able to mind control her clones, as if she was inhabiting their body.
They have explosive collars she can activate as she does not trust her clones when they are not being mind controlled by her.
