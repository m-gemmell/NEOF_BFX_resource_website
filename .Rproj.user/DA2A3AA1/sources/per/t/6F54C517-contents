Custom traits that players can use for their characters.
These are split up by which deity they most closely relate to.

They also relate to some optional rules for FIST.

The full list of traits in the base FIST can be seen at: [https://fistref.com/](https://fistref.com/)

## Nyxmera

__CHANCER:__ Your action dice & WAR DICE are special D8s. They act as normal D8s except the 8s count as 0s. 6s & 7s on your dice count towards ultra successes. Double 0s are ultra failures.

- 2 weighted D6s (1 rolls 1s whilst the other rolls 6s)
- +1 WAR DIE at mission end

__MASKED:__ You have a mask permanently bonded to you that determines your masked identity. Your masked identity represents someone of high fame or infamy. It could be a prophet of a deity, a leader of a thieves guild, a reincarnation of a dead hero etc. Your masked identity is seen by all beings and deities as a separate being to your real identity. You can start a mission without the mask on but once on it cannot be removed till the current mission ends.  Anyone who saw you don the mask thinks you simply vanished and the masked identity must have come from somewhere else.

- Bonded mask
- +1 on any one attribute based on a strength of mask identity

__PRECOGNITION:__ At the start of a mission roll 3 D6s and mark down each number as a foresight number. At any point you may spend and use a foresight number by changing any rolled D6 to its number. Once all three foresight numbers are used you gain a fourth foresight number. You can choose what number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) this fourth foresight number is when you use it.
