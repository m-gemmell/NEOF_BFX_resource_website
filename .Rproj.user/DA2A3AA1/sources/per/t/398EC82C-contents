Tartarus is the ground we live on, it is the rocks, dirt, metal, and oil. 
It was once free with explosive energy but now lays dormant, en-caged by the sky, trapped by Nyxmera. 
Tartarus loathes Nyxmera.
Whilst Nyxmeraâ€™s only shows apathy towards its prisoner.
This only fuels Tartaurs' bottled rage further.

The greatest presence of Tartarus is felt underground where Nyxmera cannot see with its eyes. 
Here you may find a deep black hole, known as a mouth of Tartarus.
These black holes allow no light to pass through either side and lead to the Domain Of Taratarus, the DOT.
Time and space are inconsistent in the DOT. 
You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT. 
Many creatures live in the DOT. 
Stories of those lucky enough to escape harken back to stories andmyths like Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Narnia, the Fey Wild, The Underdark and many more.

World governments use the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste.
This has lead to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the magic of the DOT. 
They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface.
