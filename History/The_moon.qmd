Space travel was expedited due to the world governments working together to carry it out. The Japanese refugees took this as an opportunity to create a new home as the first settlers on the moon at the start of the 1960s.

They have 2 major metropolises there called **Usagi** (Rabbit) and **Kaguya**. They specialise in combustion light-gas guns (large cannons with high velocity) and mechs. When they are ready they plan to take back Japan.
