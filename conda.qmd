title: "Conda"

Conda is a very useful tool to install bioinformatic tools without needing super user access.

Mamba is a reimplementation of conda. It is much faster than conda.

Mamba github: [https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)

My recommendation to use Mamba is to install Miniforge. It has both Conda and Mamba commands.

Miniforge installation: [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
