Tartarus is the ground we live on, they are the rocks, dirt, metal, and oil. Tartarus was once free with explosive energy but now lays dormant, encaged by the sky, trapped by Nyxmera. Tartarus loathes Nyxmera and Nyxmeraâ€™s apathy towards Tartarus fuels its bottled rage further.

The greatest presence of Tartarus is felt underground where Nyxmera cannot see with its eyes. Here you may find a deep black hole that leads to the DOT. The DOT is the Domain Of Taratarus. Time and space are inconsistent in the DOT. You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT. Many monsters live in the DOT. Think Journey to the Center of the Earth, Narnia, the Fey Wild, The underdark etc.

World governments have used the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste. This has lead to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the magic of the DOT. They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface.
