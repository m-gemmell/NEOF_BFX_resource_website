## Mission

Due to an earthquake a new cave has appeared at the extinct volcano near the village [Warboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warboys#Geology), England.
This cave has an entrance to the [DOT](/tartarus.qmd) and [DOT raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) have recently ransacked the town.

The military are currently setting up a quarantine and building a protective wall around the cave. This takes time so they want the raider trouble taken care of at the source.

The team's mission is to team up with [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) and prevent further raids from occurring.

The real threat is that [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) are currently trying to reawaken the extinct volcano.
They have attacked the Raider settlement, preventing any interference.

## Reward

If successful the military will reward the FIST team with all or some of the below items and a base upgrade (based on your system).

[Kukri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukri) (1D6+1 DAMAGE, MENACING, THIRSTY)

__MENACING__ weapon tag: Enemies who see a comrade slain by this weapon have a 1-in-1D6 chance to flee.

__THIRSTY__ weapon tag: Once this weapon is unsheathed, the weapon cannot be dropped by the user. Only once the weapon has drawn blood can it be sheathed and let go by the user.

1D6 MP5s (1D6 DAMAGE)

[Westland Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Lynx) military helicopter (16 HP, 1 ARMOR). It is a damaged prototype that will need to be repaired by FIST.

## Start of mission

The players will drive through Warboy to see the devastation brought upon it by the DOT raiders.
They will then be brought to the ad hoc base camp set up by the military.
An unfriendly lieutenant will give a brief introduction to the situation and to [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) who has also be hired by the military.

## The Expedition

The expedition is in 2 parts.
First the players will control [THE SILHOUETTE's](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) [SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONES](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#silhouette_shadow_clone) investigating the DOT.
The referee will act as [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) coordinating the crew via radio.
During this the players will each use the stats of a [SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#silhouette_shadow_clone).
Each player will control a shadow clone and there will be 2 backup clones.
When one clone dies allow the player to take over a backup clone.
The clones will most likely die.

Once the clones have died, let your players agree as to which clone died in the coolest/funniest way.
Reward that player a WAR DIE.

In the second part the players will go into the DOT to complete the mission.
They will have all the intel from the clone's incursion.
Additionally, they will hopefully have less threats.
They can also ask the military for some gear, this will require some good rolls and/or bargaining.

## The DOT

This part of the DOT is like a limestone cave with stalagmites (floor), stalactites (ground), and columns. 
However, the rocks are actually all made of [Diorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorite), a "salt and pepper" coloured rock.
It is created from magma and it is found locally around Warboys due to the extinct volcano.
Bits of magma are currently dripping from the stalactites solidifying into the Diorite.
More magma is present as the team goes deeper into the cave.
Although dangerous the magma does provide a low level of light.

## The Descent

The first obstacle once entering the DOT is the descent.
The raiders have put some shoddy metal steps into the steep and jagged rock surface.

Ask the players how they approach this and let the consequences happen.

## The Overlook Chamber {#overlook_chamber}

A large open chamber. There is relative quiet here allowing the team to investigate the rock structures and decide their plan of action.

### Overlook window

A large window high up overlooks the chamber.  There is one [TARTARUS MAGNETIC SLINGER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#magnetic_slinger) and one [TARTARUS RAIDER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider) overlooking the chamber.
The window connects directly to the Raider's chamber via a tight passage.

The pair will stay hidden and silent.
Whilst the Slinger keeps overlook the raider will go back and forth to relay messages between the overlook and Raider leader at the Raider's chamber.

They will engage the FIST team and call for reinforcements if FIST try to destroy any of the cave routes.

## Passageways

Their are three seprarate passageways that lead from the [Overlook Chamber](#overlook_chamber) to the [Killing Floor](#killing_floor).
These are The Squeeze, The Ambush, and The River.

### The Squeeze

This passage is a long winding jagged squeeze.
There are no enemies but characters who go through this will have to leave items behind to make the squeeze.
Once in deep enough they cannot go back.
Normal sized characters can only bring through one weapon, one piece of body armor, and one other piece of gear (grenade, medkit etc).
They cannot bring helmets, shields, or other large rigid items.

The Squeeze leads to a dark hallway which leads to the [Killing Floor](#killing_floor)

### The Ambush

A large chamber with a dome shaped ceiling that meets the floor.
The room is littered with stalagmites, stalactites, and columns,
At the very top of the dome there is an oculus made of Obsidian, a distraction.

When the majority of the team enters the centre of the chamber 2D6 hidden [LITHIUM TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#litium_talos) will ambush them.
1d6 are on the floor whilst the other 1D6 are on the ceiling.
The Taloes are slow and will try to position themselves in good positions before unleashing their explosive spit.
This may give the team a bit of time to react.

When the taloes die the resulting explosions will cause stalagmites and stalactites to fall.
These will may cause 1D6 damage if not evaded.

### The River

This chamber is split in half by a river of magma.
Eruptions of magma regularly break the surface, dealing 1D6 damage.
Jagged rocks and magma dripping from the ceiling makes the creation and use of a rope bridge very dangerous.

Anything that falls into the magma river takes 3D6 damage.

A ramp at the other side may be used during the [escape](#escape) if remembered.

## The Killing Floor {#killing_floor}

This chamber is distinct to the rest of the cave. 
It has a very low ceiling, is fairly narrow, and long.
It is wide enough to fit a car though.
Scattered around are columns made of crystalline iridescent [Bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth).
Small cracks of flowing magma line the floor providing a small amount of light.

At one end of the chamber are the entrances into The Squeeze, The Ambush, and The River.
At the other lays the route to the Raider's chamber.

A [METAL ORE TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#ore_talos) consisting of bismuth waits in the middle of the room.
It stands as a silent and hidden sentry, ready to kill any intruders, FIST and DOT raiders alike.
It is well disguised but has one less ARMOR due to the brittleness of bismuth.

The bismuth columns can be used as 2 ARMOR cover but the ARMOR rating is reduced by 1 when used to negate armor as the bismuth is chipped away.

## The Raider's Chamber

The Raider's Chamber is full of ramshackle shelters and old cars.
However, it is in a state of major disrepair as columns of magma flow down from the ceiling.
It has recently been attacked by the Taloes that are in the Reservoir Chamber.

The surviving group is led by an [ELDER DOTTER OF TARTARUS](/Tartarus/Followers.qmd#elder_dotter) called Axel.
Their standing force consists of 1D6 [TARTARUS RAIDERS](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider), and 2 [TARTARUS MUTANTS](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#tartarus_mutant).
There are many more injured and dead.

Every so often a new [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) emerges from the magma to attack the settlement.
The DOT raiders want to escape.
Their own only escapes are via the surface or back deeper into the DOT.
They know they will be captured if they go to the surface.
The only way deeper into the DOT is through the Reservoir Chamber containing Taloes that will kill them.

The raiders are willing to negotiate with the FIST team. 
They will not leave the chamber until there is a safe route to the DOT.
Additionally, they won't leave the surface route unguarded.
They let the clones and FIST through the Overlook Chamber unharmed as they want to negotiate with the mercenaries.

They will offer the following weapon as immediate payment if FIST agrees to take care of the Taloes in the Reservoir Chamber.

[Panzerschreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerschreck) Rocket launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE, LOUD)

__LOUD__ weapon tag: Attacks with this weapon draw the undivided attention of enemies within earshot (and instantly reveal your position).

If the players try to negotiate Axel may also offer one or both of the extras items:

1. Reinforced silver fire suit (1 ARMOR)
2. Lending the players a [TARTARUS MUTANT](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#tartarus_mutant) for the fight ahead

If the players agree, the raiders will pack their goods and injured into their vehicles so they are ready to escape through the Reservoir Chamber.
They warn once the Taloes are slain this part of the DOT will start to crumble and the FIST team will need to be ready to run back to the surface.
If they are not quick enough the caves will collapse and the new entrance of the DOT will disappear preventing their escape.

## Reservoir Chamber

A mile long corridor leads from the Raider's Chamber to the Reservoir Chamber.

The chamber is a roughly circular chamber with uneven flooring and large organised pillars. 
In the middle there is one large hexagonal pillar with cracks oozing with magma. 
Around the pillar is a mote of magma.
The magma is going towards and up into the pillar.

There are [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) surrounding the pillar performing some sort of ritual.
Depending on the level of your players start with 3 or 6.
If you start with fewer more can emerge from the lava if you feel it is appropriate.
They either like to create cover with the abundance of lava and throw their spears or charge enemies with their arm blades.

They are trying to reactivate the volcano.
If they are not stopped the village of Warboy will be destroyed and England will be blanketed in volcanic fog.

## Escape {#escape}

Once the Taloes have been defeated the caves will start to collapse.
If FIST sided with the DOT raiders they will drive through and thank FIST.
They will pick up any Raiders who helped FIST in the fight and present FIST with a rusted dune buggy to escape with.

__DUNE BUGGY__: 8 HP, 1 ARMOR.

Whilst escaping ask for various rolls to avoid lava, falling rocks, and stalagmites in the various rooms they travel through.

Once they have retreated to the surface the new entrance to the DOT will collapse and FIST will have successfully complete the mission.
