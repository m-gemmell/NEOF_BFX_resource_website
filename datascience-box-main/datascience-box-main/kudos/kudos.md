Dear Mine,

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for the wonderful Data Science in a Box materials.  I have been using them extensively in a new course I am putting together.  The title of the course is “predictive analytics” but I also am tasked with teaching them programming and getting data ready, so your course is at a great level for the students who have only had one introductory course in statistics.  I am adding and subtracting things but having your work was a life saver for me given all that is going on.  I am hopefully giving you appropriate creative attribution.

https://laurark.github.io/sta323content/slides/u1-d02-toolkit-r/u1-d02-toolkit-r.html#2 is an example of how I did it on a slide.

I have learned so much from you..  Thank you so very much for all the work you do and for your wonderful materials and training videos.

I was able to integrate the XaringanXtra scribble into my slides as well.  https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/scribble  . I was super excited, impressed and grateful Matt and Garrett built this after I asked for it.

Thank you again.

Laura
