Nyxmera is the light, literally.
All the celestial bodies are known as the eyes of Nyxmera, the sun, the grey and purple moons, the planets and the stars.
With these Nyxmera watches, they want to be entertained.

However, some think that these physical objects are Nyxmera but they are mistaken.
It is the light that comes from these that make Nyxmera.
And even though Nyxmera spans all of space it is stuck in a perpetual gaze.
No wonder it sends its avatars to Earth for some fun.
