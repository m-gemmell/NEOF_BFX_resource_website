Climate change and environmental destructions are existential threats to all life on earth.
TAG are an organisation of eco warriors.
Primarily they carry out peaceful protests and other activities that benefit the environment.

Their slogan is "you're it" . ON one hand referring to those they are targeting or will target next. And on the other a call of action for everyone else to join the environmental fight.

Some members form more radical groups that sabotage environmentally damaging facilities such as oil pipes, chemical production companies, etc.

### TAG Protestor (3 HP, CHOKE 5: Scatter and hide)

- Placard & leaflets
- Unassuming clothing with a cap
- Snacks and drinks
- Loud and proud

__CONVICTED:__ Many protesters have been previously imprisoned for their convictions. 
They can be majorly disruptive but people will only deal with them if given orders they can't refuse.
A touch from a group of protesters will cause most to join the protest. Many that join this way leave with a very foggy memory of it all.

### TAG Eco Warrior (4 HP, 1D6 appear)

- Winchester Model 1200 Pump-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
- Molotov cocktail (1D6 DAMAGE, one use)
- Hunting apparel with backpack
- Binoculars
- Normal men and women with some sign of damage by industrial exploitation

__JUSTIFIED__: Eco warriors stand up for what is right.
They have been harmed by industrial chemicals or machines.
With nothing left they will put down their lives to ensure life will continue.
They will never surrender, either fighting till the end or retreating to fight another day.
Intimidation tactics never work of eco warriors.
