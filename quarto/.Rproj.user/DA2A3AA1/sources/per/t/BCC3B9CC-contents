## Choice of mission

- Hired by Kraken (Dotters of Tartarus) to prevent sabotage by Gaians.
- Hired by TAG (Gaians) to sabotage pipeline.

3 different stations along the straight pipeline. They are situated in a dense forest. 

## Sabotaging

The team will need to hack into 3 different small stations along the pipeline.
They will be provided 4 eight inch floppy disks, 1 needed for each hack.

Two pairs of Kraken security guards at each base. If the alarm goes off, Kraken private contractors will appear in SUVs, this will take a bit of time.

At the last station there will be a Metal ore golem. It will not be alert if the alarm has not gone off.
It will never fire if the oil pipeline is in the line of fire.

## Defense

They will only need to defend one station from 3 waves.
They will have access to an imprisoned TAG spy.

The team should be encouraged to set up traps and defenses.
Other plans are encouraged.
A much easier mission but will definitely involve combat.
