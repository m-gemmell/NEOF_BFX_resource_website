The elusive ever changing deity of water. Proteus goes with the flow, loathing stagnation and overworking. Proteus is ever changing, and agreeable. It is happy to be manipulated by others. Whether forming into cloud by the sun, falling down a mountain or becoming steam by lava this occurs to water. But when it is affected by others it will leave its own mark. Beaches formed by the interaction of the moon, water, and land. Clouds blocking the sun. Formation of Islands with magma. In this changing way Proteus brings life but it can take it away. The weakness of proteus is it is frozen in the absence of heat and evaporates with too much.

The followers of Proteus are called Proteans. Due to their philosophies their organisations tend to be smaller. However, they have a lot of smaller organisations and groups. Followers include: Pharmaceutical workers, Dealers and enjoyers of alcohol and drugs, water and snow sports enthusiasts, sailors, navy, sanitation workers, climatologists, and firefighters.

Proteans play well with other factions and you will see them regularly team up with other faction organisations. Examples include; saunas with Tartarus, Healthcare with Gaia, and extreme sports events with Nyxmera.
