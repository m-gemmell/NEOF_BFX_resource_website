They can do a lot of intel gathering at the Aurora. I also encourage you to make up other stuff based on the suggestions of your players.\n\n### The Aurora\n\nThe Aurora is a ski resort run by the Daman family. \nThe main building is a post-modern brutalism building of concrete and colour.\nThe Damans have been told to accommodate the team and help with intel gathering.\n\nSome possible clues include:\n\n- Security guards: Know the locations and dates of skier and snowboarder deaths. Each was skiing/snowboarding in the dark before found dead. Some bodies were not found at all.\n- Dotters of Nyxmera stargaze every night on top of resort building. They have noticed localised Auroras. Many match nights when people went missing/found dead.\n\nThe team can freely rent use snow mobiles (3 HP, 2 ARMOR) and other skiing/snowboarding gear provided by The Aurora during the mission.\n\n### Skifry\n\nSkifry is a secluded mountain town with a logo of a purple dragon bathed by the aurora.\nThe town was founded in these mountains due to the underground hot spring acting a natural way to heat the town and produce electricity.\nUnfortunately, the underground hot spring are also the reason the cryophilic snow worms can so easily survive the cold climate here.\n\nThe Aurora makes use of the hot water and citizens of Skifry.\n\nSome possible clues include:\n\n- Library at city hall: News articles about a radio tower abandoned in the 30s due to unexplained animal attacks.\n- Recruiters for cult: Will try to recruit the players to the cult. They are careful and coy as they are currently normal humans.\n- Hospital & morgue: Recent body of a victim.\n- Indigenous centre: The resident story teller has the following story if asked about tales of worms.\n  - The native Waawate & Icelandic Jokla were a warlock pair of great power. They vanquished the mighty ice worm. Waawate summoned the Northern lights to attract the beast. Then Jokla encased it in ice.\n- Strange shopper: A strange very wrapped up individual (Mutated cultists of Skyuss) going into the food store to buy a lot of meat, potatoes, and canned food.\n\n\n## Outpost\n\nFeel free to use the below, edit it, or make your own. Enemy stats and items are here: [Cult of Skyuss](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd).\n\nThe Cult of Skyuss' outpost is an abandoned radio tower within a forest a mile above the ski slopes, on top of a ridge. An old road leads to it but otherwise snow mobiles can be used to reach the outpost.\n\nThe outpost is a square concrete 2 floor building with an inner outdoor square dominated by a radio tower.  The outpost is surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence with gate. Its insides and outside are littered with detritus and garbage. There is little else so the cult can make the place look abandoned.\n\nInside is a buzz of activity and kept very hot with many radiators. A garage is connected to the main building which contains a large SUV (8 HP, 1 ARMOR).\n\n### Lower floor\n\nThe lower floor contains 6 rooms with one hallway touching the inner walls. The rooms only connect to the hallway (except one stair case). A couple Mutated cultists of Skyuss patrol the hall and rooms.\n\nWhen entering a room use a D6 to determine which room it is from below. Ensure there is only one of each of the 6 rooms.\n\n  1. Room with stairs that lead to the next floor's hallway.\n  2. Incubation room with 3 Incubators of Skyuss.\n  3. Incubation room with 2 Incubators of Skyuss.\n  4. Recreation room with a table with some cards.\n  5. Cult of Skyuss prayer room. Books about the worm eating the planet and Gaian philosophy books.\n  6. Boiler room: If boiler is disabled the cultists will desperately try to fix as the cold will slow them down and harm them if cold enough.\n\n### Upper floor\n\nThe upper floor contains 6 rooms with a hallway touching the outer walls. The rooms only connect to the hallway (except one way into the radio tower). 4 Mutated cultists of Skyuss patrol the halls and rooms, keeping an eye out on the outside via large windows. Another 4 Mutated cultists of Skyuss are awake but on break in rooms.\n\nWhen entering a room use a D6 to determine which room it is from below. Ensure there is only one of each of the 6 rooms.\n\n  1. This room has a door that leads to a walkway with a ladder up to the radio tower room.\n  2. Sleeping quarters: 4 sleeping mutated cultists of Skyuss.\n  3. Recreation room: tables for cards, sofas and tv, and a library. Contains a book on paranormal creatures.\n  4. Kitchen: First aid spray present (heal 1D6, consumable)\n  5. Makeshift armoury: M1 Thompson submachine gun (1D6 damage) & 1 combat helmet (1 ARMOR, accessory) present\n  6. Research room: A place where the deacon experiments on worms. Notes on snow worms and altered cultists are present. Also 2 Ultrasonic harmonic frequency grenades.\n\n### Radio tower room\n\nThis is a warm room where the Deacon of Skyuss orchestrates plans and controls their Aurora generator. It contains the radio tower controls and a ceiling hatch leading to the top of the tower.\n\nThe deacon's aurora generator is mounted on the top of the tower. Accessible by a metal ladder.\n\n## Worm attacks\n\nIf Anne Lida (Deacon) has activated the aurora generator, every time a Juvenile Snow Worm appears roll a D6 to determine which room in the lower floor they emerge into. There are a total of 4 Juvenile Snow Worms that will appear. The generator can be turned off or broken to cause the worms to dig away.\n\nIf all 4 Juvenile Snow Worms appear the single living Adult Snow Worm will appear attacking worms then humans. \nThe cult have been finding its eggs for their breeding program.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/aurora_resort.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nSnow sport enthusiasts are being found dead with shark like bites at the Aurora ski resort in Skifry, Canada.
