Invisible digits allow them to handle anything a human could including guns.\n\nAll Starvatars of Nyxmera look nearly identical except for their heads. These are in the shape of something related to the human mythology of their star or the constellation it belongs to. On this head is one bright light, the star’s light they use as an eye. Examples of head shapes include:\n\n- Zodiac: Leo = Lion, Cancer = Crab , Gemini = Twins, Taurus = bull, Aries = Ram, Pisces = Fish, Aquarius = water carrier, Capricorn =  Sea goat, Sagittarius = Centaur, Scorpio = scorpion, Libra = Scales, Virgo =  Maiden.\n- Bear head from Ursa major and minor\n\nPowerful Starvatars can create temporary structures made of hard light\n\n### Stavatar of Nyxmera (9 HP)\n\n- Starlight rifle (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, MEDICAL)\n- Starlight spear (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, UNSTABLE)\n- Hard light armor (2 ARMOR)\n\n__SHADOWMAKER:__ The star avatar’s body is that of the night sky.
