### Tartarus raider {#raider}

(3 HP, 3D6 appear)

- M1911 pistol (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Obsidian blade (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Thunderstick, explosive throwing spear (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, ANTI-MATERIAL, 1 use)
- Scrap armor (1 ARMOR)
- Scrap armored school bus (12 HP, 2 ARMOR)

__HIT-AND-RUN:__ Raider war cries act as a harbinger of destruction. After a rapid pillage they scarper off leaving any wounded behind. They never abduct living things. The literal definition of scrappy, they like to bicker between themselves over loot. Tartarus raiders are good drivers and only use their thundersticks on pursuing vehicles, not wanting to destroy any possible loot.

### Tartarus fire warriors {#fire_warrior}

(6 HP)

- Flame thrower (1D6 + 1 DAMAGE, INCENDIARY)
- Napalm grenade (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, 1 use)

- Reinforced silver fire suit (1 ARMOR)
- Bottled fire spirit, 1 DAMAGE to user, heals target +1D6 HP (1 use)
- Inhibited movement and vision

__BURNT:__ These warriors have been wronged and fight for justice. They have little self preservation thinking their suits will prevent any dangerous burns. They are fiercely defensive of their allies and will attract aggro. Whilst a Tartarus fire warrior is alive and in combat, attacks to non Taratarus fire warriors have -1 DAMAGE.

### Tartarus magnetic slinger {#magnetic_slinger}

(4 HP)

- Long range gauss rifle, requires a bright and loud charge up time (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, ARMOR PIERCING)
- Tripwire grenade (1D6 + 1 DAMAGE, 1 use)
- Smoke grenade (1 use)
- Flare gun (3 uses)
- Ghillie suit
- Sluggish and cramped legs.

__VOLCANIC:__ Like a volcano this slinger is patient and difficult to detect whilst dormant. However their weapon provides an obvious signal to their target a few seconds before they can fire. Will use their flare gun to call for backup or attract prey.
