Thankfully the Kaiju are kept land bound on the main Japan island by the powers of Gaia & Proteus.\nDue to this Nuclear weapons are banned by world governments leading to uneasy peace. This leads to the formation of major superpowers.\n\nUSA: United States of America. The number one superpower consisting of all the Americas\nCAC: Coalition of African Countries. All of Africa.\nERA: European & Russian Alliance. Europe & Russia.\nSAE: Supreme Asian Empire. All Asian countries except Russia with India & China co-leading uneasily.\nOceania: Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, and other small islands.\nBritish Isles: England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Greenland, Iceland, and other smaller islands. Also known as the biway.\n\nThe financial hub of the world. A great place for off shore bank accounts and laundering money.\nA haven for fugitives of other countries with capital.\nMany of the world’s elites and most dangerous live here benefitting from interacting with each other.\nViolent crimes are not tolerated in the British isles A great place for FIST to be based but in one of the less wealthy areas (Ireland, Wales, Isle of Man, or Isle of Wight).\nGreenland is used for nuclear power generation to sell to the world (primarily the USA) and to keep armies stationed.\nIceland is where many more dangerous scientific research is carried out.\n\n\nSpace travel was expedited due to the world governments working together to carry it out. The Japanese refugees took this as an opportunity to create a new home as the first settlers on the moon at the start of the 1960s. They have 2 major metropolises there called Usagi (Rabbit) and Kaguya. They specialise in combustion light-gas guns (large cannons with high velocity) and mechs. When they are ready they plan to take back Japan."

Here you may find a deep black hole that leads to the DOT. The DOT is the Domain Of Taratarus. Time and space are inconsistent in the DOT. You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT. Many monsters live in the DOT. Think Journey to the Center of the Earth, Narnia, the Fey Wild, The underdark etc.\nWorld governments have used the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste. This has lead to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the magic of the DOT. They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface."

They will wait till their prey are surrounded by them before attacking. When they die they explode for 3 DAMAGE, this may cause a cascade of explosions from all the Lithium golems.

Although the most human looking of all the golems they are also the most terrifying. They give off constant nuclear radiation which they use to power their weapons and armor. Anyone within melee range gets -2 to action rolls and loses 1HP per action.\nGEM: Their real body is their gem which has 3HP. If this is not destroyed the golem will reform in 1D6 days. Its gear is not part of its projection."
