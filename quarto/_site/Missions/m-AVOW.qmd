## Dilemma

Team chooses one of 2 options:

- Hired by Gaians to stop the assassination attempts during the wedding.
- Hired by [Camera Obscura](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd) to assassinate the 2 brides. Camera Obscura agents are known as shutterbugs.

Two very rich and influential brides are to marry at a very opulent wedding. One is an [ELDER DOTTER OF TARTARUS](/Tartarus/Followers.qmd#elder_dotter) called Ruby and one is a [PROTEAN CAPTAIN](/Proteus/Followers.qmd#protean_captain) called River.

The wedding takes place at a extravagant estate built by the [Ruby River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_River) in southwestern Montana.

## Preventing assasination

FIST must stop the Camera Obscura shutterbugs.
The players will be told by the Gaians when the assassinations will occur but have no further intel.
The players can gather intel and should try to figure out who the shutterbugs are and their mode of assassination before the events.

However, they will be informed to not capture or stop the shutterbugs until each of their scheduled events.
Otherwise an unknown less cautious backup shutterbug ([NYXMERA DARK TROPPER](/Nyxmera/Troops.qmd#nyxmera_dark_tropper)) will appear in their place.

## Carrying out assassination

The player team will get the chance to kill the brides in their nuptial bedroom. They must do this before they have started consummation of their marriage.

However, they will also need to stop the 2 assassination attempts at the ceremony and dinner. Due to the Camera Obscura rules they cannot harm, kill, or kidnap the other "shutterbugs".

The Camera Obscura client wants the assassination to occur at 1 of three times.
They will not pay if it occurs outside of these times.


## Assassination events

### Ceremony

Kill them before they both say I do.



### Dinner

Kill them during the dinner. The dinner takes place in a large ball room with dining tables, a dance floor, and a stage with various bands and performances throughout the evening.

The designated shutterbug is the [Antidoter](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#antidoter). 
They have poisoned the entire wedding cake.

### Nuptials

Kill them in their nuptials bedroom before the wedding is consummated.

Ignore the below shutterbugs if the players are carrying out the assassination.
Team of assassins breach into guarded VIP building.
