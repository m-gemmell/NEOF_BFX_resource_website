Although the most human looking of all the taloes they are also the most terrifying. They give off constant nuclear radiation which they use to power their weapons and armor. Anyone within melee range gets -2 to action rolls and loses 1HP per action.\n\n__GEM:__ Their real body is their core which has 3HP. If this is not destroyed the talos will reform in 1D6 days.
