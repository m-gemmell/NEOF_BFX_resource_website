Camera Obscura agents are known as shutterbugs.\n\nTwo very rich and influential brides are to marry at a very opulent wedding. \nOne bride is called River Dullcoin, an [ELDER DOTTER OF TARTARUS](/Tartarus/Dotters.qmd#elder_dotter). She is the daughter of Marian Dullcoin, CEO of [Kraken](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd).\nThe second bride is River Ox, a [PROTEAN CAPTAIN](/Proteus/Followers.qmd#protean_captain).\nThey are a famous and well renowned figure skating coach, many of her skaters having won golds in the winter Olympics.\n\nThe wedding takes place at a extravagant estate. It is by the [Ruby River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_River) in southwestern Montana.\n\n## Preventing assasination\n\nFIST must stop the Camera Obscura shutterbugs.\nThe players will be told by the Gaians when the assassinations will occur but have no further intel.\nThe players can gather intel and should try to figure out who the shutterbugs are and their modes of assassination.\n\nThe team will be informed to not capture or stop the shutterbugs until each of their scheduled events.\nOtherwise an unknown less cautious backup shutterbug ([NYXMERA DARK TROPPER](/Nyxmera/Troops.qmd#nyxmera_dark_tropper)) will appear in their place.\n\nThe team must do this covertly without the wedding guests, including the brides, realising what they are doing or that assassination attempts are occurring.\nThe guards of the wedding have been told and will recognise and help the FIST team.\n\n### Rewards\n\nDepending on how well they accomplished the mission they will get up to 3 rewards. Some demerits include if they were spotted, and if they only saved one bride.\n\n1. Warhammer (1D6+1 DAMAGE, HEAVY, ROOTS)\n2. 1D6 bulletproof vests (1 ARMOR)\n3. Medical supplies (1D6 medkits, +1D6+TAC HP)\n\n__HEAVY__ weapon tag: This thing is too big to be called a weapon. Once per mission, take +3 on a FORCEFUL roll that involves this weapon.\n\n__ROOTS__ weapon tag: Once per mission, after hitting a target roots will explosively grow from the impact site. This can weaken cracked structures, bind objects or individuals together, and various other effects.\n\n## Carrying out the assassinations\n\nThe player team will get the chance to kill the brides in their consummation bedroom. They must do this before they have started consummation of their marriage.\n\nHowever, they will also need to stop the 2 assassination attempts at the ceremony and dinner. Due to the Camera Obscura rules they cannot harm, kill, or kidnap the other \"shutterbugs\".\n\nThe Camera Obscura client wants the assassination to occur at 1 of three times.\nThey will not pay if it occurs outside of these times.\nAdditionally, Camera Obscura will not pay shutterbugs who harm, kill, or kidnap any of the other guests as there are many rich and powerful people.\n\n### Rewards\n\nDepending on how well they accomplished the mission they will get up to 3 rewards. Some demerits include if they broke Camera Obscura rules, and if they only killed one bride.\n\n1. [Steyr SSG 69](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steyr_SSG_69) bolt-action sniper rifle (1D6+2 DAMAGE, HUD)\n2. Combat knife (1D6 DAMAGE, LUCKY)\n3. 1D6 smoke grenades & 1D6 frag grenades (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\n\n__HUD__ weapon tag: Scans hostiles. When you kill something new, the referee will tell you a useful fact about it.\n\n__LUCKY__ weapon tag: Rolling an ultra success while attacking with this weapon grants the user one WAR DIE.\n\n## Wedding events\n\nThe wedding is broken into several events. \nOnly the Ceremony, Dinner, and Consummation will have an assassination attempt.\n\nAll the events take place on the estate grounds.\nNo maps of the estate are given so you can create your own vision with the prompts in the below descriptions.\n\n### Rehearsal dinner\n\nThe rehearsal dinner takes place the evening before the actual wedding. It will be in the same ball room described in the [Dinner](#dinner_event) section. No assassination will take place but it is a prime time for the players to carry out some intel gathering on the hired shutterbugs.\n\n### Ceremony\n\nThe ceremony takes place outside in a area flanked by the Ruby River and a rock garden full of beautiful geodes.\n\n[THE KING](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_king) is using one of their personas (Aurelia Blaine) to attend the wedding as an invited guest.\nDuring the rehearsal dinner she will will steal River's wedding ring. THE KING will attempt to set their curse on River and the wedding ring.\nThey will entertain and perform card tricks for the brides to get close to them.\n\nClue: Players will overhear one of the bridesmaids saying they have lost River's ring as they recruit help from the other bridesmaids.\n\nIf not stopped the couple will turn into gold as Ruby puts River's ring on during the ceremony.\n\n### Figure skating break\n\nAfter the ceremony the wedding party will move onto an outdoor skating rink.\nHere, River's past and present skaters (all guests to the wedding) will provide an amazing show.\n\nAsk each of your players for a name of one of the skaters, then ask them for a name and description of a figure skating move.\nGive a WAR DIE to the player with the skater and move the table agrees is best.\n\n### Dinner {#dinner_event}\n\nThe dinner takes place in a large ball room dominated by a central large ornate water fountain sculpted from rock.\nOn one side of the room lay the tables for the dinner.\nOn the other is a large stage and dance floor.\n\nThe dinner will consist of the speeches followed by the main meal.\nThe brides will then cut their wedding cake which will lead to their first dance.\n\nThe designated shutterbug is [THE ANTIDOTER](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_antidoter). \nThey have poisoned all the food with the first part of their poison and the entire wedding cake with the second part.\n\nClue: During the dinner the 2 brides will leave and a fog machine will go off before the dancing commences. This is the work of the THE ANTIDOTER.\n\nIf not stopped the couple will die of heart attacks during their first dance.\n\n### Entertainment\n\nAfter watching the first dance, the guests will join in the festivities with drinking and dancing.\nVarious famous bands will play on the stage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ruby is a big fan of Rock and Metal bands.\nAsk your players for some fictional bands that will be performing.\nGive a WAR DIE to the player with band name the table agrees is the best.\n\n### Consummation\n\nAt the end of the night the newly wedded couple will leave the ball room and go to their private building within the estate.\nThis building is secluded on top of a rock outcropping.\nIt is flanked by the river and surrounding forest.\nOne side of the building is a large glass wall that overlooks the Ruby River.\n\nIf the players are assassinating they must do so after the couple have entered the building but before they have consummated the wedding.\nIn this case the building is guarded by 4 [KRAKEN SECURITY GUARDS](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd#kraken_guard).\nThe team will succeed if they kill both brides and partially succeed if they kill at least one.\n\nIf the players are stopping the assassinations, the last shutterbug is the [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette). They will be parked a few miles away as they send in their 4 [SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONES](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#silhouette_shadow_clone) to storm the private building.\nThe clones will try to stealthily enter but are not afraid to enter a gunfight.\nThe team will succeed if they save both brides and partially succeed if they save at least one.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/M-AVOW.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Dilemma\n\nTeam chooses one of 2 options:\n\n- Hired by Gaians to stop assassination attempts during the wedding.\n- Hired by [Camera Obscura](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd) to assassinate the 2 brides.
