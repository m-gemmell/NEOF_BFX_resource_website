[Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd) to investigate the deadly infestation of bipedal Horseshoe crabs ([HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd)) on [Lantau Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantau_Island) and [Chek Lap Kok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chek_Lap_Kok).\n[Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd) had started building the Hong Kong International airport on [Chek Lap Kok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chek_Lap_Kok), this has been stopped due to the infestation.\n\nThe islands are being quarantined from the rest of Hong Kong with martial law in place.\nAll citizens have been rounded up to [Tung Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung), a fishing village turned town due to the new labour force for airport construction.\n\nThe team has special dispensation to take care of the menace but the military and others will not look kindly if they are caught snooping in the affairs of government of other companies.\n[Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd) will provide them with a translator who knows the main language of the team and Cantonese (the main language of Hong Kong), the translator will not leave [Tung Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung).\n\n## What is going on?\n\n__Rangi Doshi__ ([CGC SCIENTIST](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist)) and his team of [CGC SCIENTISTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist) have created the [HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd).\nOne of the breeding [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) was blessed by all four of the Primeval deities, it then escaped the facility via the sewers.\nIt became a [BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#brooding_horseshoe_crab_mutant), producing many HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS.\nIt named itself __Farrier__ and it's brood scour the city, looking to rescue their kin.\n\n## Clues\n\nThere are various clues that can help the team figure out what is going on.\n\n### Sightings & attacks\n\nThe [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) are sighted in many areas but there is a noticeably higher amount near hospitals and graveyards.\nThey have also been sighted stalking the sick and elderly.\n\nSurprisingly they are not that violent, seemingly only attacking when provoked.\nHowever, there are some humans they have attacked without provocation.\nIf they team look up the victim's health records they will see that most were diagnosed with gout.\nThis is because __Farrier__ has been tortured by __Dr. Ranga Doshi__ in the past and she remembers the smell of gout on him.\n\n### Food poisoning\n\nA local restaurant, famous for only serving shellfish based meals is being closed down by the police as patrons have died of food poisoning. \nSome victims who were admitted to Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research) are being successfully treated.\nThose who went to North Lantau Hospital or Tung Chung Health Centre did not survive.\n\nIf they confront the owner or get information from the police they will find out the owner has been serving the [HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#horseshoe_crab_mutant) meat.\nTheir usual supply of canned horseshoe meat currently has a shortage.\nUnknown to them their supply was from the CGC who's prized spawner (__Farrier__) escaped.\n\nIf the team successfully investigate at Yan Oi Tong they will find out the patients were treated for pufferfish poisoning (tetrodotoxin).\nOne of the CGC scientists gave this advice to one of the doctors.\n\n### Medical conference\n\nA medical conference was in force at one of [Tung Chung's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung) hotels.\nMany medical researchers and doctors are now stuck during the quarantine.\nThis keeps the nicest hotel out of the hands on evacuees and the military which they are more than happy to grumble about.\n\nThe large conference room has been changed into a disaster relief zone with many makeshift beds.\nThe occupants are using the leftover posters as extra blankets.\nOne poster is about Horseshoe crabs and how their blood is harvested to create compounds to help test vaccines.\nIt was being presented by a PhD student of __Dr. Ranga Roshi__, based at Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research).\n\n### Environmental scientists\n\nEnvironmental scientists are trying to map out the diversity of the island.\nThey have been keeping track of the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS movements.\nThe player's team may find them following the mutants around the __Tung Chung__ and even outside of it, sneaking through a construction zone at the edge of the town.\n\nThe scientists have deduced they are some sort of hybrid between [Atlantic horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_horseshoe_crab)and [Mangrove horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_horseshoe_crab).\nThey have also deduced that the mutants are coming from the Mangrove forest west of [Tung Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung).\nThis is where __Farrier__ is located.\n\n### Clogged sewers\n\nThere are issues with the sewers being clogged. This is due to the roe of the [BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#brooding_horseshoe_crab_mutant) accumulating in the sewers. \nThis is also where the [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) hatch and emerge from.\n\n## Ranga and the CGC {#ranga_n_cgc}\n\n__Dr. Ranga Doshi__ ([CGC SCIENTIST](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist)) and his team works for the [CGC](/Gaia/CGC.qmd).\nThey are responsible for the creation of the HORSEHOE CRAB MUTANTS.\nThe CGC are powerful and the Hong Kong military and police will not take kindly to the team openly investigating them.\n\n__Dr. Doshi's__ team carries out research in a hidden and secure floor below the basement of the Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research). \nAlthough they can speak Cantonese, they are so secretive they communicate and write in Hindi within the lab.\nThe CGC specifically sent a hindi team to Hong Kong for this reason.\n\n### Dr. Ranga Doshi\n\n__Dr. Ranga Doshi__ is a well respected scientist of the CGC.\nHe is a tired man with a limp due to his gout.\nHe takes great care of his team and is a very likeable man.\nHowever, he hates animals and enjoys inflicting pain on them.\nHe is smart and hides his zoosadism, except when it comes to arthropods.\nHe loves eating animals, especially shellfish. \nThe only non meat food he eats are carb-based foods such as rice and bread to eat along with meat.\n\nHe is normally found in one of 6 places:\n\n1. __His office:__ Taking calls, having one-on-one meetings, researching, preparing lectures etc. He can also be found sleeping in a temporary cot.\n2. __Patrolling the lab:__ Although a nice boss in ways he tends to micromanage and change his mind often.\n3. __Teaching:__ He gives lectures and tutorials within the lecture tehatres and labs of the main hospital.\n4. __Mingling:__ He will go to the hotel hosting the medical conference to mingle with other medical researchers.\n5. __Restaurants:__ He always eats at restaurants.\n6. __Spawning pen:__ He sometimes likes to find a newly spawned MUTANT HORSESHOE CRAB to torture alone.\n\nOutside of his research lab he is always escorted by two [CGC SECURITY](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#security) members.\n\n### CGC staff\n\n__Dr. Doshi's__ team consists of 2 types of staff:\n\n- [CGC SCIENTISTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist): Members of his research team.\n- [CGC SECURITY](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#security): Security to keep people out and the specimens in the lab.\n\nThe team can be found in the main hospital from time to time.\nThe scientists help tutor students.\nAll the staff take their breaks in the canteen and recreational rooms of the main hospital.\nCurrently some are sleeping in the main hospital due to the quarantine and martial law.\n\n### Research\n\nThe team carries out research and experiments on:\n\n- [Atlantic horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_horseshoe_crab): collected for blood harvesting.\n  - The blood contains amebocytes which are used to create LALs, used to test vaccines.\n- [Mangrove horseshoe crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_horseshoe_crab): contain [tetrodotoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin).\n  - Lethal neurotoxin, the same that makes pufferfish, and blue-ringed octopuses so deadly.\n  - If used correctly it can also be used as a treatment of cancer-associated pain.\n  - May also be able to be used as a recreational drug, as seen by dolphins who get high on it via pufferfish.\n\nThe team genetically engineered the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS.\nThey have carried this out to get a variety of uses from them.\n\n- [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant)\n  - Blood harvested for LALs\n  - Roe is sold as food\n  - Some used to spawn more HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS\n  - Once no longer of use they are killed and their tetrodotoxin is harvested\n- [MALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#male_horseshoe_crab_mutant)\n  - Fertilisers\n  - Sold as meat as they do not contain tetrodotoxin\n\nThe team have also created a toxin that only kills the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS.\n__Dr. Doshi__ initially does not want to use it as it will taint the island's water supply and most likely make its way into their research lab, killing their specimens.\n\n### Research floor\n\nThe CGC research floor is a large hallway branching off like a trident from the elevator.\nAll rooms have large windows that allow a generous view into and from the hallway.\n\nThe [CGC SCIENTISTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#scientist) primarily work in the:\n\n- __Research rooms:__ Tables with computers and notes along with a library of medical & zoology textbooks.\n- __Dissection lab:__ Room to study the anatomy of Horseshoe crabs and the mutants.\n- __Tetrodotoxin extraction:__ The scientists carry out tetrodotoxin extraction as it is too technical for the security staff.\n\nThe [CGC SECURITY](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#security) patrol the halls and work within the following rooms:\n\n- __Spawning pen:__  Contains 6 dedicated cages for [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) to produce new spawn. One cage has been ripped apart from the inside.\n- __Harvesting room:__ Along the walls are tied up [FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant). Tubes are collecting their dark blue blood.\n- __Roe prep:__ Roe are passed through a fine-mesh screen, salted and packed into metal tins, ready for sale.\n- __Meat prep:__ Males are cleaned and cut. The meat is then shredded, refrigerated, and sent to a canning company.\n\nThere are no recreational rooms, staff having to use other floors for this.\nThere are 2 toilets but one is out of service as it was ripped off the floor when the [BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#brooding_horseshoe_crab_mutant) escaped.\nThe exposed pipe has been blocked.\n\n## Farrier\n\n__Farrier__ is a [BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#brooding_horseshoe_crab_mutant).\nIt has become intelligent and formed a hive mind with its children, aiming to find and rescue its brethren from the [CGC](/Gaia/CGC.qmd).\nIt is staying within the Mangrove forest west of [Tung Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung_Chung) ([Hong Kong Wetland Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Wetland_Park) as of 2006).\nIt does not remember where it escaped from only that it smelt of human blood, the sick, and the dead.\nIt sends out its daughters ([FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant)) to search.\nIt produces an abundance of offspring with 4 [MALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#female_horseshoe_crab_mutant) that were on the its back when it escaped the lab.\n\nThe [Mangrove forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_forest) are wetlands in coastal intertidal zones.\nThey are named for the [Mangroves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove) that inhabit them.\nThey are incredibly wet making travel by car or foot very difficult.\nIf the team wants to explore the Mangrove forest they will most likely need a boat.\nThey could fly by helicopter but will find it difficult to find __Farrier's__ nest due to the Mangrove canopy.\n\n## Resolution\n\nAlthough the team could resolve this in many ways there are 2 main methods.\n\n### Kill Farrier\n\nThe most obvious method is to kill __Farrier__, the [BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#brooding_horseshoe_crab_mutant).\nIf she is killed the hivemind will break and cannot be reformed.\nThis will cause all the remaining HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS to become unintelligent and unorganised creatures that can be easily dealt with by the Hong Kong military.\nWith this option the team may be able to talk with __Dr. Doshi__ to gain his help in their plan.\nIf, so and they successfully kill __Farrier__, he will reward the team with a choice of either a [CGC body serum](#cgc_body_serum) or a [CGC mind serum](#cgc_mind_serum)\n\n### Help Farrier\n\nThe other method is to help __Farrier__, the [BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT](/Gaia/CGC.qmd#brooding_horseshoe_crab_mutant).\nIf the team encounter her she will telepathically communicate with them.\nShe will ask they help her free her kin from the CGC.\nIf they do she will leave the island to go live within the oceans.\nShe will reward the team with a __blessed barnacle__.\n\n__Blessed barnacle:__ Once per mission attach the barnacle surface to a hard surface. \nThis causes many tennis ball sized barnacles to cover the surface. \nThis may strengthen the surface and make it more climbable.\n\n### Mission completion\n\nAs long as they rid the islands of the MUTANT HORSESHOE CRAB infestation the team's employer ([Pumice construction](/Proteus/pumice_construction_ltd.qmd)) will be happy. They will reward the team with:\n\n[Type 79 submachine gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_79_submachine_gun) (1D6+1 DAMAGE, LIGHT)\n\n__LIGHT__ weapon tag: Weighs almost nothing.
