This takes time so they want the raider trouble taken care of at the source.\n\nThe team's mission is to team up with [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) and prevent further raids from occurring.\n\nThe real threat is that [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) are currently trying to reawaken the extinct volcano.\nThey have attacked the Raider settlement, preventing any interference.\n\n## Reward\n\nIf successful the military will reward the FIST team with all or some of the below items and a base upgrade (based on your system).\n\n[Kukri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukri) (1D6+1 DAMAGE, MENACING, THIRSTY)\n\n__MENACING__ weapon tag: Enemies who see a comrade slain by this weapon have a 1-in-1D6 chance to flee.\n\n__THIRSTY__ weapon tag: Once this weapon is unsheathed, the weapon cannot be dropped by the user.

It is a damaged prototype that will need to be repaired by FIST.\n\n## Start of mission\n\nThe players will drive through Warboy to see the devastation brought upon it by the DOT raiders.\nThey will then be brought to the ad hoc base camp set up by the military.\nAn unfriendly lieutenant will give a brief introduction to the situation and to [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) who has also be hired by the military.\n\n## The Expedition\n\nThe expedition is in 2 parts.\nFirst the players will control [THE SILHOUETTE's](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) [SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONES](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#silhouette_shadow_clone) investigating the DOT.\nThe referee will act as [THE SILHOUETTE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_silhouette) coordinating the crew via radio.\nDuring this the players will each use the stats of a [SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONE](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#silhouette_shadow_clone).\nEach player will control a shadow clone and there will be 2 backup clones.\nWhen one clone dies allow the player to take over a backup clone.\nThe clones will most likely die.\n\nOnce the clones have died, let your players agree as to which clone died in the coolest/funniest way.\nReward that player a WAR DIE.\n\nIn the second part the players will go into the DOT to complete the mission.\nThey will have all the intel from the clone's incursion.\nAdditionally, they will hopefully have less threats.\nThey can also ask the military for some gear, this will require some good rolls and/or bargaining.\n\n## The DOT\n\nThis part of the DOT is like a limestone cave with stalagmites (floor), stalactites (ground), and columns. \nHowever, the rocks are actually all made of [Diorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorite), a \"salt and pepper\" coloured rock.\nIt is created from magma and it is found locally around Warboys due to the extinct volcano.\nBits of magma are currently dripping from the stalactites solidifying into the Diorite.\nMore magma is present as the team goes deeper into the cave.\nAlthough dangerous the magma does provide a low level of light.\n\n## The Descent\n\nThe first obstacle once entering the DOT is the descent.\nThe raiders have put some shoddy metal steps into the steep and jagged rock surface.\n\nAsk the players how they approach this and let the consequences happen.\n\n## The Overlook Chamber {#overlook_chamber}\n\nA large open chamber. There is relative quiet here allowing the team to investigate the rock structures and decide their plan of action.\n\n### Overlook window\n\nA large window high up overlooks the chamber.  There is one [TARTARUS MAGNETIC SLINGER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#magnetic_slinger) and one [TARTARUS RAIDER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider) overlooking the chamber.\nThe window connects directly to the Raider's chamber via a tight passage.\n\nThe pair will stay hidden and silent.\nWhilst the Slinger keeps overlook the raider will go back and forth to relay messages between the overlook and Raider leader at the Raider's chamber.\n\nThey will engage the FIST team and call for reinforcements if FIST try to destroy any of the cave routes.\n\n## Passageways\n\nTheir are three seprarate passageways that lead from the [Overlook Chamber](#overlook_chamber) to the [Killing Floor](#killing_floor).\nThese are The Squeeze, The Ambush, and The River.\n\n### The Squeeze\n\nThis passage is a long winding jagged squeeze.\nThere are no enemies but characters who go through this will have to leave items behind to make the squeeze.\nOnce in deep enough they cannot go back.\nNormal sized characters can only bring through one weapon, one piece of body armor, and one other piece of gear (grenade, medkit etc).\nThey cannot bring helmets, shields, or other large rigid items.\n\nThe Squeeze leads to a dark hallway which leads to the [Killing Floor](#killing_floor)\n\n### The Ambush\n\nA large chamber with a dome shaped ceiling that meets the floor.\nThe room is littered with stalagmites, stalactites, and columns,\nAt the very top of the dome there is an oculus made of Obsidian, a distraction.\n\nWhen the majority of the team enters the centre of the chamber 2D6 hidden [LITHIUM TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#litium_talos) will ambush them.\n1d6 are on the floor whilst the other 1D6 are on the ceiling.\nThe Taloes are slow and will try to position themselves in good positions before unleashing their explosive spit.\nThis may give the team a bit of time to react.\n\nWhen the taloes die the resulting explosions will cause stalagmites and stalactites to fall.\nThese will may cause 1D6 damage if not evaded.\n\n### The River\n\nThis chamber is split in half by a river of magma.\nEruptions of magma regularly break the surface, dealing 1D6 damage.\nJagged rocks and magma dripping from the ceiling makes the creation and use of a rope bridge very dangerous.\n\nAnything that falls into the magma river takes 3D6 damage.\n\nA ramp at the other side may be used during the [escape](#escape) if remembered.\n\n## The Killing Floor {#killing_floor}\n\nThis chamber is distinct to the rest of the cave. \nIt has a very low ceiling, is fairly narrow, and long.\nIt is wide enough to fit a car though.\nScattered around are columns made of crystalline iridescent [Bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth).\nSmall cracks of flowing magma line the floor providing a small amount of light.\n\nAt one end of the chamber are the entrances into The Squeeze, The Ambush, and The River.\nAt the other lays the route to the Raider's chamber.\n\nA [METAL ORE TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#ore_talos) consisting of bismuth waits in the middle of the room.\nIt stands as a silent and hidden sentry, ready to kill any intruders, FIST and DOT raiders alike.\nIt is well disguised but has one less ARMOR due to the brittleness of bismuth.\n\nThe bismuth columns can be used as 2 ARMOR cover but the ARMOR rating is reduced by 1 when used to negate armor as the bismuth is chipped away.\n\n## The Raider's Chamber\n\nThe Raider's Chamber is full of ramshackle shelters and old cars.\nHowever, it is in a state of major disrepair as columns of magma flow down from the ceiling.\nIt has recently been attacked by the Taloes that are in the Reservoir Chamber.\n\nThe surviving group is led by an [ELDER DOTTER OF TARTARUS](/Tartarus/Dotters.qmd#elder_dotter) called Axel.\nTheir standing force consists of 1D6 [TARTARUS RAIDERS](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider), and 2 [TARTARUS MUTANTS](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#tartarus_mutant).\nThere are many more injured and dead.\n\nEvery so often a new [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) emerges from the magma to attack the settlement.\nThe DOT raiders want to escape.\nTheir own only escapes are via the surface or back deeper into the DOT.\nThey know they will be captured if they go to the surface.\nThe only way deeper into the DOT is through the Reservoir Chamber containing Taloes that will kill them.\n\nThe raiders are willing to negotiate with the FIST team. \nThey will not leave the chamber until there is a safe route to the DOT.\nAdditionally, they won't leave the surface route unguarded.\nThey let the clones and FIST through the Overlook Chamber unharmed as they want to negotiate with the mercenaries.\n\nThey will offer the following weapon as immediate payment if FIST agrees to take care of the Taloes in the Reservoir Chamber.\n\n[Panzerschreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerschreck) Rocket launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE, LOUD)\n\n__LOUD__ weapon tag: Attacks with this weapon draw the undivided attention of enemies within earshot (and instantly reveal your position).\n\nIf the players try to negotiate Axel may also offer one or both of the extras items:\n\n1. Reinforced silver fire suit (1 ARMOR)\n2. Lending the players a [TARTARUS MUTANT](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#tartarus_mutant) for the fight ahead\n\nIf the players agree, the raiders will pack their goods and injured into their vehicles so they are ready to escape through the Reservoir Chamber.\nThey warn once the Taloes are slain this part of the DOT will start to crumble and the FIST team will need to be ready to run back to the surface.\nIf they are not quick enough the caves will collapse and the new entrance of the DOT will disappear preventing their escape.\n\n## Reservoir Chamber\n\nA mile long corridor leads from the Raider's Chamber to the Reservoir Chamber.\n\nThe chamber is a roughly circular chamber with uneven flooring and large organised pillars. \nIn the middle there is one large hexagonal pillar with cracks oozing with magma. \nAround the pillar is a mote of magma.\nThe magma is going towards and up into the pillar.\n\nThere are [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) surrounding the pillar performing some sort of ritual.\nDepending on the level of your players start with 3 or 6.\nIf you start with fewer more can emerge from the lava if you feel it is appropriate.\nThey either like to create cover with the abundance of lava and throw their spears or charge enemies with their arm blades.\n\nThey are trying to reactivate the volcano.\nIf they are not stopped the village of Warboy will be destroyed and England will be blanketed in volcanic fog.\n\n## Escape {#escape}\n\nOnce the Taloes have been defeated the caves will start to collapse.\nIf FIST sided with the DOT raiders they will drive through and thank FIST.\nThey will pick up any Raiders who helped FIST in the fight and present FIST with a rusted dune buggy to escape with.\n\n__DUNE BUGGY__: 8 HP, 1 ARMOR.\n\nWhilst escaping ask for various rolls to avoid lava, falling rocks, and stalagmites in the various rooms they travel through.\n\nOnce they have retreated to the surface the new entrance to the DOT will collapse and FIST will have successfully complete the mission.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/DELVE.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Mission\n\nDue to an earthquake a new cave has appeared at the extinct volcano near the village [Warboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warboys#Geology), England.\nThis cave has an entrance to the [DOT](/tartarus.qmd) and [DOT raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) have recently ransacked the town.\n\nThe military are currently setting up a quarantine and building a protective wall around the cave.
