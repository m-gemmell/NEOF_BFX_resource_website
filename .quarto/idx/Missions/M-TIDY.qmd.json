raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) charge the team with infiltrating The Big Hole dump yard in Kimberley, South Africa.\nDump yards are where trash, chemicals, and nuclear waste are disposed of by tipping it into the [DOT](/tartarus.html#the-dot).\nThese sites are heavily guarded due to the contents but also to stop [DOT raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) and [kaiju](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd) from reaching the surface via the mouth into and out of the DOT.\n\nThis site was originally the [Big Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hole) open pit quarry.\nHowever, once they found the mouth into the [DOT](/tartarus.html#the-dot) it was developed into a dump yard.\nThey made the hole wider and now it is used to remove the vast majority of hazardous trash for the [CAC](/History/CAC.qmd) and some neighbouring countries.\nIt is run by __Carafe__, a subsidiary company of [Kraken](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd).\n\nThe team are provided with a __floppy disk__ by the [DOT raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) to disable the security systems including automated turrets. \nHowever, it will also disable the Kaiju Sonic Disruption System (KSDS).\nWhen/if this occurs small kaiju, [SCORPIUS](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#scorpius), will rush into the dumping site only to be followed by a massive kaiju, [PYTHON](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#python). \n[PYTHON](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#python) consists of three gigantic serpents connected by a giant obsidian orb.\n\nDouble twist, this was a plan by [The Mooners](/History/The_moon.html) to test out their [CARGO MECHA](/History/The_moon.html#cargo-mecha) against a real kaiju. \nOnce [PYTHON](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#python) emerges the KSDS will reactivate, stopping further [kaiju](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd) from leaving the [DOT](/tartarus.html#the-dot).\nThe team will be able to pilot [CARGO MECHAS](/History/The_moon.html#cargo-mecha) hidden within cargo crates to stop the [kaiju](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd).\nThere will also be back-up rods from god on hand if the [CARGO MECHAS](/History/The_moon.html#cargo-mecha) fail.\n\n## The Big Hole dump yard\n\nThe dump yard is a large circular hole with sheer vertical walls.\nDark, noisy, deep, and hot it is easy to forget you can look up at the sky.\nThere are only two ways in and out, the Elevator and the Mouth.\n\nEmbedded into the cliff wall are cranes used to move cargo crates.\nThese cargo crates fill up most of the space giving The Hole a feeling of a subterranean cargo dock.\nSeagulls squawk but the salt smell is replaced with that of damp, rot, and chemicals.\n\n### The Elevator\n\nAt the north of the hole is a large open elevator going from the surface to the bottom of the pit.\nIt is primarily used to move loaded cargo crates down, fill of trash, and empty crates back up.\nSo utilitarian is the elevator that passengers are transported up and down in a designated cargo crate.\n\nAt the surface, near the elevator, lie many train tracks and container cranes.\nIt runs 24/7 with many trains coming and going.\n\nThe elevator is slow and takes a long time to go up or down.\nIt makes up for this by being able to transport 20,000 cargo crates at a time.\n\n### The Mouth\n\nAt the south of the hole is a large cave.\nWithin this is a Mouth of Tartarus, an entrance to the [DOT](/tartarus.html#the-dot).\nThe mouth is a pitch black circle that lays completely flat to the earth.\nRemote controlled machines tip trash filled cargo crates into the mouth, the operators at a safe distance on the second floor of the Node. \n\n### The Node {#security}\n\nThe node is a large 5 story cylindrical building in the very centre of the Big Hole.\nBlacked out Windows line the entire circumference, with bright white concrete it gives off the appearance of a striped vase.\nAnother post-modern brutalist building, walls within the building either curve parallel to the circumference or run radially.\n\nThe Node acts as the main building for staff with security increasing as you go up the floors.\nThere are no stairs instead a single pill shaped elevator in the centre of the building provides access to the floors.\nHowever, this elevator requires a pair of security cards, requiring at least 2 passengers at a time.\n\n#### Ground floor\n\n__Reception, museum, and canteen (Level 1 security)__\n\nThe entrance of the building contains a reception and a small museum about The Big Hole and the Carafe company. \nIt is all boring, sterile corporate propaganda.\nIt shows how proud the company is to have automated defences to resist [DOT raider](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) and [kaiju](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd) incursions.\n\nA large room at the back contains a canteen for the staff.\n\n#### 1st floor\n\n__Living quarters and recreation rooms (Level 1 security)__\n\nVarious recreation rooms with tvs, games tables, and libraries. \nIt is a surprisingly still place, employees taking a reprieve from the exhausting labour. \nThey live in these quarters for 14 days whilst working, then go to their homes until they want/need to work another shift. \n\nA separate section for security guards requires a pair of Level 3 security passes to access.\n\n#### 2nd floor\n\n__Operations and engineering (Level 2 security)__\n\nWhere the real work in the building is done. Team leaders congregate to meet and coordinate the day to day running.\n\nCrane operators work within booths, remote controlling the cranes.\n\nThere are also workrooms for engineers to fix smaller issues and help other engineers via radio. \nThese rooms contain many tools and manuals.\n\n#### 3rd floor\n\n__Management (Level 3 security)__\n\nOffices for any important members of staff. Contains a few penthouses for visiting VIPs. Furnished with expensive paintings specifically designed to fit along the curved walls.\n\n#### 4th floor\n\n__Security (Level 3 security)__\n\nThis floor contains the command room for security.\nFrom here the 2 security co-heads, __Arno__ and __Lindewe__ watch over the CCTV cameras and relay orders to the rest of security.\nThis same room contains all the various terminals related to the defenses.\nThis is where the floppy disk will need to be used.\n\nOther rooms include contains an armoury, gym, and practice shooting range.\n\n## Security\n\nSecurity is run by [Kraken](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd) with many pairs of [KRAKEN SECURITY GUARDS](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd#kraken_guard) patrolling the site.\nThe security is co-run by:\n\n- __Arno__ (he/him), meaning eagle, the [KRAKEN SECURITY WATCHER](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd#kraken_watcher)\n- __Lindewe__ (she/her), meaning waited for, the [KRAKEN SECURITY COMMANDER](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd#kraken_commander)\n\nThere are 3 levels of security conferred by security passes.\nThey are hierarchical, meaning level 3 security has the access of 1, 2, & 3.\nDifferent staff members have different levels.\n\n- __Level 1__: Reception, hospitality, and janitorial staff. These staff members must be escorted by a pair of [KRAKEN SECURITY GUARDS](/Tartarus/Kraken.qmd#kraken_guard) if they need access to higher clearance areas.\n- __Level 2__: Engineers, and machinery operators.\n- __Level 3__: Management and security guards.\n\nAlong the cliff wall, top of the Node, and within the Mouth are mounted auto guns (1D6+1 DAMAGE).\nThey have very primitive auto firing tech so targets must be chosen by security within the control room in the Node.\n\n## Infiltration\n\nThe method of infiltration is left up to the referee and their players.\nFor inspiration a list of prompts is provided below:\n\n- The team disguises themselves as corporate investors and so tour the site\n- The team get jobs within the site\n- The team stowaway within a trash cargo crate\n- The team parachutes on top of the node for a quick and dirty approach, very high risk\n- The team digs their way into the site\n\n## Kaiju vs Mecha\n\nAs soon as the security system is deactivated a siren will go off with a voice clearly stating \"Warning KDS deactivated\" repeatedly.\nThe terminal screen will show a map of the Hole with a position marked with a red crescent moon, towards the south west.\nIt will instruct their mission has changed and they must kill the invaders from the DOT.\nThey must use what is in the cargo crates marked with the flag of [The Moon](/History/The_moon.qmd), a red crescent moon on a white background.\nHaste is urged.\nOf course, if any members want to stay in the Node to reactivate and use the defenses they shoudl be allowed to try.\n\nSoon massive amounts of [SCORPIUS](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#scorpius) will escape from from the DOT and infest the site.\nThis will keep the security guards busy and make the team's trek to the designated spot dangerous.\n\nIf they successfully arrive at the crates they will find one for each team member, this is also a good place for emergency insertions.\nWithin each crate is a [CARGO MECHA](/History/The_moon.html#cargo-mecha) that will take the team member as its pilot.\nNow the team have a chance against the [kaiju](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd).\n\nAfter some combat with the swarm of [SCORPIUS](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#scorpius) a large rattle will sound from the Mouth.\nThis will cause the kaiju to instantly flee but many close to the cave will be decimated as [PYTHON](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#python) emerges.\nThe team will be informed the mission is to eradicate it.\nThankfully no more kaiju will emerge as the KDS warning ceases.\n\nThe team will be informed a Rod from God satellite is moving into position above the Hole. \nThey will be able to fire this every 10 actions, or alternative option of your choice, but will need to use the handheld laser targetters within their mechas to aim it.\nEach Rod from God attack does 3D6+3 DAMAGE with the ANTI-MATERIAL tag (Deals double DAMAGE to vehicles and structures; cumbersome to carry around ([F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))).\n\nThe site is littered with stacked cargo containers acting as obstacles to movement.\nMany contain hazardous, flammable, and explosive materials.\nUse these as the referee and players see fit.\n\nAdditionally, there are also large cargo cranes that could be used by the team to pin or harm [PYTHON](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#python).\n\n## Reward\n\nOnce all of [PYTHON](/Tartarus/Kaiju.qmd#python) is killed the mission will end, the team being able to easily escpe in the chaos.\nThe team will be rewarded with one newly rolled up [CARGO MECHA](/History/The_moon.html#cargo-mecha) and an appropriate cargo crate for transport.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/M-TIDY.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Mission\n\n[DOT
