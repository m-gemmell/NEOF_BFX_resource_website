They appear to humans as homunculus consisting of the organisms it represents. Some of the most powerful are the Kingdom Forms of bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals. There are many smaller Forms including birds, mould, diseases, tardigrades and many more. \n\nA Form’s goal is to bring about unification. They attempt this by promoting growth of its flock, converting others into its likeness or destroying anything not like it. In this way the Forms can be mothers of life, cultivators of rot, or sowers of death.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/Gaia.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nLife was created by the combination of light, earth, and water.
