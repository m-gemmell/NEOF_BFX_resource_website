A large company developing and selling drugs, both licit and illicit. It is an open secret they sell illicit drugs with many knowing Triton as the licit side and Delta as the Illicit side. They primarily create new drugs charging many local companies to produce, and distribute.

This is not only led by Proteans but many Gaians involved in health services. However, Gaian involvement normally is limited to the licit side.
