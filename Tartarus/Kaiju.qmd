Kaiju are giant monsters from the DOT.

## SCORPIUS {#scorpius}

(6 HP)

- Tail sting (2D6 DAMAGE)
- Claws (1D6 DAMAGE), grapples target
- Carapace (1 ARMOR)
- 2 metre long scorpion
- 2 scorpion tails with an obsidian orb at the tail base
- Cracks over body glow a dark red

__VICIOUS:__ These massive scorpions are deadly to others and themselves.
When attacking with its tail sting, if the defending player rolls a partial success the SCORPIUS takes half of its DAMAGE, the target only taking half as well.
If the defending player rolls a full success SCORPIUS takes all the DAMAGE.
DAMAGE is applied normally to the target and the SCORPIUS avoids this DAMAGE if the target is grappled by it.
