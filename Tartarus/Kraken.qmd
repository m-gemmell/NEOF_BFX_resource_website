## KRAKEN SECURITY GUARD {#kraken_guard}

- Hard hat (accessory)
- High vis jacket
- Half a key card each
- Prone to ask ridiculous either or questions with their buddy (“Would you rather fight a horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?”)

__SAFETY BUDDIES:__ Two guards make a whole. For security they are each given half of any security passes so both must be present, stopping 1 captured/pilfered guard from allowing breaches. They can and will use their hazard foam grenades to subdue trespassers.

__BIOLOGICAL__ weapon trait: Only damages biological beings. Cannot damage structures, vehicles, or chemicals.

Anyone who disparages the SLAGGER takes an extra +1 DAMAGE from the SLAGGER's attacks.
