## Linux access

Prior to running through these materials you will need to have acces to a Linux terminal. The 2 main methods are a terminal on your own computer or connecting to remote a machine such as an HPC. Below are a variety of methods to gain this.

### Computer terminal

Depending on the OS you are using there are differetn ways to access a temrinal.

#### Windows

Windows has a terminal but it is not Linux based. You can install a subsystem of Linux to use Linux on your windows machine. This is carried out with WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux). The following is a link on how to install WSL: [Windows install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) 

#### Linux & macOS

If you are using a Linux or macOS machine you can use the terminal to carry out Linux commands.
This is possible as macOS is a Unix-based system.

If you would like to install and use a Linux OS we recommend Linux Mint. The following link is a guide to install Mint Linux:  
[Mint Linux install](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Remote access

For remote access you can use a terminal to `ssh` to the remote machine.

If you are on a windows machine you may need to download a terminal program to `ssh` to a linux cluster. Below are a few suggestions of windows terminals:

-   [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
-   [Putty](https://www.putty.org/)

#### ssh

The `ssh` (Secure Shell Protocol) command is used to login into cluster and other machines. For more information on this please see the following online tutorial: [ssh tutorial](https://opensource.com/article/20/9/ssh)

#### File transferring

When working with a remote cluster you will most likely want to transfer files from your computer to the cluster and vice versa.

For transferring on windows machine I would suggest [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php).

For transferring on macOS & Linux I would suggest [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

## The Terminal Window

Your terminal may look similar to the below image. We are using the terminal window as our shell to interpret our commands to the kernel. Depending on your system and preferences it will most likely look different.

Already there is useful information for us on the terminal window.

-   **nsc206**: This is the login name, also known as the username. In this case nsc206 is a demonstrator's account. Your screen should show a different account name which will be your username for the Linux machine/cluster you are logged into.
-   **ada02**: This is the machine name the user is logged into.
-   **\~**: This represents the current directory of the user, or the directory a command was run in. In the Linux OS and others **'\~'** is a short cut to the user's home directory.
-   Everything after the **'\$'** is where commands are typed into the terminal. This is also referred to as the command line.

To open a new terminal window, right click on the main screen, choose `Applications` -\> `Shell` -\> `bash`

## Commands

Commands are typed into the terminal and then run by pressing **"enter"**"

</center>

To run a command select your terminal by clicking on it or using **"alt+shift"**.

Now run the below command:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo "Hello World"
```

In this case `echo` is a command that prints out the term "Hello World".

Now try:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo "Bye World"
```

There are many different Linux commands and we will run through a few. With a large variety it can be hard to remember all the commands and how they work.

Three convenient resources are:

1.  **Search engines** (e.g. Google): There are many forums where people ask for help with command line issues. If you have an issue and are not sure what to do, most likely someone else has had the same issue and asked for help on a forum. The tricky part of this is knowing the specific terminology to use when searching. Forums where people ask bioinformatics questions include SEQanswers, Stack overflow and biostars.
2.  **Cheat sheets**: It is never wrong to "cheat" when coding. Cheat sheets with many commands and good descriptions are very useful. Here is a good example of one: <https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf>
3.  **Manual pages**: Linux commands have many different parameters and options. If you ever need to figure out what they all are and what they do you can use the `man` command.

E.g. The below command will show the manual page for the echo command:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
man echo
```

The below command will show the manual page for the `man` command:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
man man
```

**Note**: The `man` page acts like using the command **less** (we will get into more specifics later). Important notes for now are to use the **arrow keys** to go **up** and **down** the page and press **q** to exit the manual

**Note**: There is a cheat sheet at the end of this document with all the commands covered in this practical.
