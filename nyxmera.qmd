Nyxmera is the light.
All the celestial bodies are known as the eyes of Nyxmera, the sun, the grey moon, the purple moon, the planets, and the stars.
With these Nyxmera watches, it wants to be entertained.
Something its followers, Suns of Nyxmera, are more than happy to facilitate.

Nyxmera is everything but Earth.
It craves what it can't take.
There is so much of interest on such a tiny orb, so Nyxmera is stuck in a perpetual gaze.

Its logo represents the duality of the sky and Nyxmera's eyes. On one side the blue sky and sun. 
On the other, the night sky with the Grey Moon and Purple Moon. 
Nyxmera loves extremes; good and evil, comedy and drama, love and war.
