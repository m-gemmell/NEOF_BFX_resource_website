Ablation occurs to meteoroids as they enter the earth's atmosphere.
This occurs due to the erosive impacts of atmospheric particles.

Pudding was an astronaut.
As the pilot they had to make an emergency landing in their shuttle.
This went disastrously wrong as the shuttle burnt up and all Pudding's crew died.
Pudding came out ablated, a smooth human with no hair or recognisable features.
The US government blamed Pudding for the accident.
Now Pudding only wants to make them regret that.


Mission will involve the use of [asteroid laser ablation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_laser_ablation) to have meteorities strike certain cities.
